## Quick Summary

- Industrial Networks:
  - level categories: management level, cell level, field level
    - from (slow, large data) to (fast, small data)
  - realtime requirement categories: non-realtime, soft-realtime, hard-realtime
- Wireless standards in Industrial Networks: 
  - 802.15.4 series(ZigBee)
  - Bluetooth
  - 802.11 series (Wi-Fi)
  - LPWAN(SigFox,LoRa)
  - Cellular network.(3G,4G,5G,NB-IOT...)
- IEEE 802.1 TSN: 
  - handling time synchronization, control congestion, reliability communication.
  - mechanism: 
    - Time synchronization
    - QoS control
    - Traffic identification
    - Network configurations
- TSN Challenge in Wireless communication
  - major different of wireless to wired communication
    - variable capacity, high per.
  - fundamental problem:
    - latency and jitter due to congestion
    - packet loss due to fading and collision
  - Wireless channel variety : capacity is dynamic
  - Large/Unreliable channel access latency: 
    - LTE: grant protocol, random access 
    - Wi-Fi: LBT protocol
    - Industrial requirements: ultra low latency and reliable communication
  - Interference and coex of different standards.

- New Approach To extend TSN to Wireless
  - Wireless Network Management by a single entity, devices implements a minimal set of features (CUC and CNC)
  - Time Synchronization for Wireless
    - 802.1as PTP over 802.11: TM/FTM(resolution to x00 us)
    - New Area for 5G.
  - Time-Aware Scheduling by synchronize to a common clock, control channel queue globally to control collision.(802.1Qbv)
  - Wireless link reliability: 
    - power control to handle interference, 
    - time-frequency resource management to optimize overall capacity and provide reliable transmission
    - spatial diversity and Beamforming to enhance link quality.
    - new waveform design: reduce out-band emissions, reduce overhead of short packets(typical in industrial traffic)
    - adaptive MCS selection with feedback csi.
    - redundant channels for better reliability.
- Next Generation Standard capability for TSN enhancement
  - 802.11ax : 
    - scheduled access and multi-user ofdma, 
    - 2M RU enhance link quality 8dB vs 11ac, 
    - OFDMA-MU-diversity, 
    - flexible GI(handling outdooor channel), 
    - new 6G band to legacy standard interface-free and scheduled channel access.
    - Target wake time(TWT) for power saving and sub-groupping of devices for better resource management.
  - 5G URLLC: 
    - low latency frame structure
      - slot time to 0.125ms
      - fast dl/ul switching and HARQ interval
      - self-contained data/ack in a sub-frame.
    - physical enhance: support LDPC and URLLC
    - low latency signaling: DMRS
    - Architecture enhancement: CRAN and SDN, edge comupting
  - Industrial Wireless Network Applications categories: 
    - Class A: supports current tech with enhanced features in 11ax/5G
    - Class B: Soft-time-sensitive(AR/VR,HMI,) and selective hard-time-sensitive(controller)
    - Class C: Hard realtime controllers with very low cycle times, ex. 802.11be EHT
