# Extending Accurate Time Distribution and Timeliness Capabilities Over the Air to Enable Future Wireless Industrial Automation Systems

- Proceeding of IEEE.


## INTRODUCTION

- New industrial applications require the **time coordinated** **computing** and **communications** over **wireless** links
  - Ex. AVG/MR
- Some application requires
  - Precise synchronization to a reference time down to **nanoseconds accuracy**
  - Deterministic (bounded) end-to-end latency
    - in us to ms level
  - Extremely low packet loss probability
  - Coverage of time critical and noncritical taffics in the same network.
- IEEE 802.1 TSN Task Group develops standards to enable time synchronization, bounded latency, redundancy, preemption.

### Industrial Networks

- **Field Level** 
  - communication among **sensor**, **actuators**, and **controllers** 
  - typically has the most stringent **latency** and **reliability** requirements
  - Throughput requirements relatively low 
  - extremely short cycle times (in the order of microseconds) and low jitter
    - PROFINET, EtherCAT, and SERCOS III
  - IEC 61784 International Standard
- **Cell Level**
  - mostly communications between PLCs(Programmable Logic Controller) and between PLCs and industrial PCs
  - require time synchronization and various levels of real-time guarantees
  - relax performance
  - served by IP-based communication over Ethernet
- **Management Level**
  - typical IT infrastructure
  - Flexible data exchange within industrial systems
  - IT/OT(operation process) convergence
  - reuse of IT Technology in operation process
  - cost savings
  - ﬂexibility expected from future industrial networks in supporting a variety of applications
- Category of real-time requirements
  - **Non real-time**:
  - **Soft real-time**: realtime iter-action between devices and/or human
    - require low latency 
    - not necessary tight time sync
    - tolerate some missed deadlines
  - **Hard realtime**: require **accurate** synchronization and timeliness (**bounded latency**)
    - isochronous
    - mainly at the ﬁeld and cell levels.
    - Wireless networks have been used primarily in non-real-time applications and in a few soft real-time applications

### Wireless Netweorks in Industrial Environments
- the deployment of wireless technologies is only at its infancy (無線技術的部署還處於起步階段)
  - **AI** application and movement to ensure **flexible data access** driving deployment of wireless technologies. 
- **IEEE 802.15.4**: 
  - several PHY modes for operation in the 2.4-GHz and sub-GHz (868/916 MHz) unlicensed bands
  - also several MAC layer modes
  - CSMA-based communication: device sensing channel before transmission, back-off when busy
  - data rate up-to 250Kbps for 2-M BW in 2.4G 
  - **ZigBee**
    - ZigBee defines networking and transport protocol of 802.15.4.
    - non-realtime application
  - **802.15.4g**: New PHY for long range and higher data rate.
       
- **IEEE 802.15.4e**: 
  - TSCH(Time-Synchronized Channel Hopping) access
  - High reliability and power-saving
  - Enable **low power consumption** with better control of **latency** compared to CSMA protocols
  - can be used across a mesh network
  - TSCH mode may also be used with the more recent 802.15.4g mode
  - 6TiSCH: define an IPv6 compatible layer to enable conﬁguration and exchange of schedules in a TSCH network

- **Bluetooth**:
  - local connectivity between phones and other consumer devices operating in the 2.4-GHz band
  - a frequency hopping PHY
  - BT1.2: 1Mbps, BT2.0: EDR, BT3.0: highspeed, BT4.0: BLE, for low power
  - Add mesh capability
  - play a role in many HMI(human machine interface) and wearable applications in industrial environments
  - mesh capability enable sensor network application.
- **IEEE 802.11 Wi-Fi**
  - consumer, enterprise, and industrial markets, mainly for general IT connectivity
  - a, b, g, n, and ac from 2007
  - currently mainly 11n/11ac for OFDM and MIMO capability to very high data rate.
  - 11ax next major release: enable multi-user transmission simultaneously.
  - MAC:
    - Based on CSMA 
    - Enhanced QoS: enables trafﬁc prioritization through four main access categories(voice, video, best-effort and backgroud)
    - Contention free polling-based options(PCF,HCCA), but not supported in practice for mainstream Wi-Fi provider
  - been used in industrial applications.
  - has great potential to enable fast IT/OT convergence and ﬂexibility in the manufacturing processes.
- **Cellular Technologies**:
  - machine-to-machine communications
  - have been used mainly in industrial systems
  - GPRS, 3G, LTE-m, NB-IOT
  - Goal to reduce power consumption and cost. but not provide realtime performance.
- **LPWAN**: 
  - Sub1g communication
  - SigFox/LORA
  - very low throughput over wide areas without hard latency and reliability requirements (mostly nonreal time)

### IEEE 802.1 TSN
- Enable time synchronization, control congestion, and packet loss due to media or device failure
  - mainly assuming **Ethernet** as layer 2 transport 
- subset of TSN standard and capability
