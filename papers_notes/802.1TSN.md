## CHALLENGES FOR WIRELESS TSN

- Two fundamental problems: 
  - latency and jitter caused by network congestion
  - packet losses 
- Wired link
  - constant capacity and 
  - extremely low packet error rate
  - bandwidth reservation can guarantees latency/jitter
  - preemption avoid interference from best effort traffic
  - redundancy path reduce loss from HW.
- Two fundamental different of Wireless media to Wired
  - Variable capability
  - Typically high per
  - Make challenges in providing deterministic latency and reliability guarantees expected by time-sensitive applications.

### Wireless Channel Variations

- Wireless channel capability is dynamic.(from fading, interference, ranges...)
- high capacity and bounded latency is not always possible.
- Understand Channel behavior is key to access achievable latency, reliability and capability
- 11n/11ac: TGN-channel model for indoor and statistic outdoor
- 11ax:  ITU-R channel and Doppler fading.
- Channel models are generic enough to statistically represent a plethora of propagation environments
- Ray-tracing tool for analysis of the well-defined environments, 
  - providing coverage maps
  - fading statistic
  - power-delay profiles
  - rms delay
  - coherence bandwidth....

### Channel Access Latency

- major source of latency in LTE:
  - grant acquisition
  - random access procedures
- major latency source in WiFi: 
  - listen-before-talk (LBT) channel
  - increasing access delay when increasing of devices.
  - randomess of LBT protocol is the key issue for hard realtime application.
- Need to support ultralow-latency service with deterministic access to medium and low-jitter
- Multiple-access technologies:
  - FDMA,TDMA,CDMA,OFDMA,SDMA,NOVA 
    - OFDMA + SDMA has been adopted in current cellular and Wi-Fi 
    - NOMA: non-orthogonal multiple access
      - new approach, but receiver need to perform successive cancellation.
      - not been adopted in major wireless standards
  - Multichannel access strategies
    - the device to access multiple channels and initiate multiple data transmissions independently
    - need multiple radios to sense and contend for access simultaneously in multiple channels

    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/wt69z2h.png" style="width: 450px" align="center"/>
  
  - Latency-speciﬁc optimizations should cvonsider the unique and dynamic characteristics of wireless channels and links.

### Centralized Coordination and Scheduling

- hard to control latency through distributed random access, expecially under congestion
- Need centralized coordination of medium access
  - 3GPP: NodeB/eNodeB/gNodeB
  - Wi-Fi: traffice is scheduled by AP, scheduling becomes important in 11ax OFDMA.
- (New) scheduling algorithm need to consider
  - throughput, fairness, and plus stringent **latency** and **reliability**.
- Distribute schedule information to devices
  - 3GPP: devices are assigned deterministic access opportunities once admitted
  - Wi-Fi: transmitted by the AP before every transmission opportunity

### Interference and Coexistence

- Not problem in Wired communication.
- More challenge in requirements of both TSN and non-TSN traffic in a converged network.
- Non-time-sensitive traffic: multiple retransmission to ensure payload delivey
- Opportunity retransmission is limitted in hard-real-time traffic.
- Interference sources: 
  - other kind devices(protocol) in the same channel band.
  - self-interference due to schedule coflict
  - RF emmissions: microwave ovens, electrical machinery, welding arches, power plants, cablings
    - dominantly contained in the sub1G band, and may have little or no effect in higher bands (2.4G,5G)

## NEW APPROACHES TO EXTEND TSN CONCEPTS TO WIRELESS

- Reference protocol stack
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/EvuwgOi.png" style="width: 450px" align="center"/>

- 802.3 major supported
- 802.11 supports some capability: time synchronization
- ongoing standards
  - 802.11 extends TSN capability
  - 3GPP to introduce TSN on next generation standards

### Wireless Network Management Model

- wireless network should be managed by a single entity
- All devices can implement a minimal set of required features (CUC and CNC)
  - CUC: collects information about the critical trafﬁc streams
  - CNC: uses this information to perform admission control, define/deployment resource allocation strategies to meet time-sensitive applications
  - Wireless devices and APs should be conﬁgured by the same CUC and CNC entities
- Infrastructure and end devices support interoperable methods and protocols

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/BCXTMdy.png" style="width: 450px" align="center"/>

### Wireless Time Synchronization

- 802.1as define PTP over 802.11
  - time measurement capability in 802.11-2012 
  - Fine time measurement capabilities (~ x00ns)
- 3GPP: no synchronizing the radio and applications to the same clock
  - new area in 5G URLLC

### Time-Aware Scheduling

- 802.1Qbv time-aware scheduling: gates synchronized to a common reference clock
  - control queue process (opening/closing) by sharing a common egress(出口) port within an Ethernet switch
  - global scheduler defineS time to open/close the queue to eliminate congestions and make time-bounded latency 
- Exampe model of 802.1Qbv
  - when queue open, transmission selection selects a data frame to send and delivers it to the 802.11 MAC layer.
  - MAC follows a random access procedure, and could introduce random delays to transmission
<img src="https://imgur.com/CrNKMJo.png" style="width: 600px" align="center"/>
- Potential solution of challenge to reduce the random delay
  - TDM to control the wireless medium access refer to the global reference time between wireless devices.
  - The scheduler assign time slots to devices aligned with the end-to-end latency of each data frame.
  - Scheduler need to ensure the end of the traffic within associated time slot due to the variety of channel capacity
- Extends 802.1Qbv in 802.11 need to modify MAC layer to enable distribution control by Qbv server.

### Wireless Link Reliability

- Relaiable transmission challenge due to fading, interference of other device and inter-emmision from other system.

<img src="https://imgur.com/OraRJuG.png" style="width: 600px" align="center"/>

- Several techniques can be used to improve reliability: power control, resource scheduling, spatial diversity/BF, waveform design.

#### Transmit Power Control

- increase power can get better reliable but will interference other devices.
- To control each device power to ensure the guarantees of the reception with limited power
- Unlicensed band need to follow transmit power spectrum mask spec.

<img src="https://imgur.com/wlBxtJ3.png" style="width: 600px" align="center"/>

#### Optimal Time–Frequency Resource Scheduling

- Reliability enhancement by scheduling transmit in good time-frequency resources
- Example in LTE and 11ax OFDMA  downlink OFDMA.
  - AP get CSI of each device and select good for each one to optimize the transmission efficiency and quality.
  - CSI is the overhead of the system capacity.

#### Spatial Diversity or Beamforming

- Spatial diversity and BF enhance power efficiency and reliability.
- still need CSI feedback.

#### PHY Waveform Design

- OFDM has better spectrum efficiency and good fadding resistence. 
- But poor out of band emission and generate interference to other band.
  - Mitigation of the out-of-band emission
    - windowing, filtering, subcarrier weighting, carrier cancellation, mapping antipodal symbol pair onto adjucent subcarrier, precoding.
- Short packet is common in industrial communication. current 802.11/LTE packet format suffer efficiency issue for short packet.
  - Luvisotto et al. propose a new design approach for supporting small packets with lower latency by reducing some of the overheads in the 802.11 OFDM PHY. 
    - (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7924385)


#### Adaptation of Modulation and Coding Scheme

- MCS adaptation to make transmission rate meets channel capacity according to CSI feedback.
- Ref:(https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7588154/)

#### Redundancy

- Frame Replication and Eliminations is introduced in the IEEE 802.1CB to improve reliability.
- Multiple-link aggregation is already supported in both the LTE and 802.11 standards
  - focus only on increasing the throughput and not for hard real-time and reliability requirements

### Time-Sensitive Applications Classiﬁcation and Wireless Roadmap

- Applications that involve moving parts and mobile devices(robots, AGVs, and AR/VR) be the ﬁrst to take advantage of new wireless TSN capabilities
- A classiﬁcation of industrial applications
  - Class A: supported by current wireless technologies (LTE and 802.11ac and ax) with proper enhancements for admission control, latency-optimized scheduling, and introduction of time-aware (802.1Qbv) concepts
  - Class B: Soft-time-sensitive(AR/VR,HMI,) and selective hard-time-sensitive applications(controllers) require higher reliability than class A in single-digit milliseconds (以數毫秒為單位).
    - required network planning and optimizations in 802.11ax and 5G URLLC
  - Class C: hard realtime controllers with very low cycle times, such as motor control. The 802.11 EHT(distributed MIMO, multi-AP, and low latency enhancements) could enable class C.

### Wireless Experimental Platforms

-  Experimentation with 802.11/Wi-Fi is relatively easier than with 3GPP technologies.
-  The experiments in synchronization need to fundementally access low-level MAC and PHY. But current vendors will not open the FW.
-  SDR platform have been to enable research and development with MAC and PHY. 
   -  USRP, WARP, GNU Radio
   -  Architecturally, an SDR platform consists of a **front-end module** and a **signal processing module** implemented in FPGA or a combination of FPGA and system on chip(SoC)
   -  could be found in markets, very common chips offer 100MHz in 6GHz band. 
   -  Software toolchains: NI instrument and MathWorks 
- A low-latency SDR system(Tick) provides programmable and  ensure low-latency throughput accelerator-rich architecture, and HW/SW codesign.
- SDR hardware and software tools will need to be enhanced to enable new wireless capabilities as well as implementation optimizations that can address the strict TSN requirements.
